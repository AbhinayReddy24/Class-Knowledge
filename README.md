# Class-Knowledge

This is a open source website to share and access class notes or presentations materials form the professors that we want to learn but can't attend that class or we are not registred in that class but we are interested in that class, cause I have experienced 
This class notes is extensively useful as this contains compressed professor knowledge and resources pointed in right direction to learn more about it 
- **Most important thing is taking proefssor's consent before uploding to the website **
- **this is a collaborative platform so any suggestions are welcome **
